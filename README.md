# COVID-19-Global-Tracker

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based analysis of global COVID-19 trends using the `covid_19_clean_complete.csv` dataset. It visualizes confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for Kenya, USA, and India, providing insights into pandemic patterns and country-specific impacts.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical COVID-19 data to identify trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Create visualizations (line charts, bar charts, and a choropleth map) to compare Kenya, USA, and India.
- Summarize key insights and anomalies, such as the Delta variant wave in India.
- Provide a reproducible notebook for educational or reporting purposes.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations (line and bar charts).
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical plotting.
- **Plotly**: For interactive choropleth maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.
- **Kaleido**: For rendering Plotly maps (optional, for export).
